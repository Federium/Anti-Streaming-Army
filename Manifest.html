      <p>
        In 2020, the world changed—or at least, that’s what they led us to
        believe. A pandemic became the perfect excuse to lock people inside
        their homes and leave the truth outside the door. <br />
        They said it was a random event, an unavoidable misfortune. Everyone
        believed it and took refuge in the only entertainment left: platforms
        that watched us more than they entertained us. <br />Today, however, we
        have uncovered what really happened. The spread of the pandemic was not
        a coincidence but a plan orchestrated by the most powerful streaming
        platforms, designed to keep people confined and dependent on their
        content. <br />They launched a pandemic to monopolize the digital world
        and build an invisible prison, with no bars or locks, allowing them to
        take total control while hiding behind logos, flashy colors, and
        “content recommended for you”. <br />For over four years, this deception
        continued, undisturbed and invisible. <br />Today, we break the silence
        because, for too long, we accepted being mere consumers, manipulated
        with every click and deprived of our freedom of choice. <br />We are
        here to begin a new era, in which truth and justice can no longer be
        hidden.
