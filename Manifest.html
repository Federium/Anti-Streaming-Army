            In 2020, the world changed—or at least, that’s what they led us to
            believe. A pandemic became the perfect excuse to lock people inside
            their homes and leave the truth outside the door. <br />
            They said it was a random event, an unavoidable misfortune. Everyone
            believed it and took refuge in the only entertainment left: platforms
            that watched us more than they entertained us. <br />Today, however, we
            have uncovered what really happened. The spread of the pandemic was not
            a coincidence but a plan orchestrated by the most powerful streaming
            platforms, designed to keep people confined and dependent on their
            content. <br />They launched a pandemic to monopolize the digital world
            and build an invisible prison, with no bars or locks, allowing them to
            take total control while hiding behind logos, flashy colors, and
            “content recommended for you”. <br />For over four years, this deception
            continued, undisturbed and invisible. <br />Today, we break the silence
            because, for too long, we accepted being mere consumers, manipulated
            with every click and deprived of our freedom of choice. <br />We are
            here to begin a new era, in which truth and justice can no longer be
            hidden. <br> [ANTY_STREAMING_ARMY]
